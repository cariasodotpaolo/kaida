                    <h4>Artist’s Notes: The Pleasures of Doing Art in a Diseased Century</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making visible the invisible is the work of an artist. The physicality of an idea, its sole provenance, comes from this. Yet, some of this meandering, generated on canvas, paper, metal and stone can be conceptually distant, placed there largely, and willfully, outside the orbit of interpretation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What do we make of them? What do they all mean? Works that can’t be deciphered have to be invested with new meaning altogether. Investing interpretation is always the order of the day. This isn’t the sole import of artists, though, as religious charlatans can be equally rabid in their blind parroting of the sacred. Our world is a Rorschachian Paradise; hence intervention stamps a dichotomy between a personal and an “other”. The “other”, in this case, could be the imposing embodiment of an imperialist narrative, or even a slight fabrication from a homogenous source, like that which resides underneath the cloistered kimonos of old Japan. This conflation and borrowing from a supplemental source is our way of making sense of things. There’s always a hint of the postmodern in this approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some mild appropriation can be employed, as seen in the Japanese “shunga” and anime component of this show. The danger here is that it renders an asynchronous thread to the work— hijacked, perhaps, by my shallow understanding of “the other”. It could be the Duchampian conceit of the ready-made at work here. In the service of our Art-making, we make full use of what is available, what is readily assimilated within the purview of culture, politics, gender, economics and whatever can be shared and appreciated by our roving constellation of eyes. We desperately need these conceptual and ideational cruxes sourced from popular culture, delivered to us faster than our hungry synapses could possibly process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Closer to my skin, some paintings in this suite deal with the mortal bones; the materiality of paint subsuming the look and smell of rotting flesh. Yellow ochre, paynes grey, alizarin crimson and titanium white gloss over the inconsistency and the pale patina of collapsing chromosomes— reinvigorating the flesh where this fragile vessel of blackened meat and bones used to be. We celebrate death and we celebrate life even more so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I celebrate Painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 20 works in this show are premeditations for larger ones, a crucial step in the process. These are complete studies to be explored further on bigger canvases, tackling and elevating the themes and ideational constructs. By then, I hope to make sense of these forbidden, conflicted and delicious conundrums and effect a sense of nowness onto them relevant to our future histories.

                <h2>#artfusion!</h2>
                <h3>A Group Exhibition featuring Rene Cuvos, Demet Dela Cruz, Darwin Guevarra, Philipp Ines, Jim Orencio, Migi Sebastian, Mike Seiling and Manuel Sintos</h3>
                <h4>9 JULY 2017</h4>
                <p>
                Fusion and Dissociation
                </p>
                <p>
                In #artfusion!, low brow art is presented side by side with calming garden views, steampunk automatons, pensive figures, childhood dreams and dynamic abstracts, as steely creatures in flight, mixed media work spiked with LED lights and a video installation dot the gallery space. These create a heterogenous array of distinctive artworks in synthesis. By representing diverse media through their personal styles, the artists are given a free reign on the individuation and exploration of their own concerns and concepts, leading to a cohesive cross-sampling of disciplines in one engaging visual sweep.
                </p>
                <p>
                Flight seems to be a common ground, with several pieces centered on the subject. Migi Sebastian’s Kinetic Sculptures take on avian and arthropod forms in equilibrium with assembled scraps of metal and gears, some of them in motion. Philipp Ines’ Guni-Guni takes advantage of childhood play and imagination with oil and pencil on canvas as he recreates the illusion of corrugated cardboard against a clear blue sky. This contrasts nicely with Manuel Sintos’ Pilot 1, an oil on canvas painting illustrating a boy with toy helicopters and planes with an overlay of text that seems to underscore the longing for freedom and aerial navigation.
                Automation and mobility may also be held as a theme in Darwin Guevarra’s paintings, Midnight Blue Traveler and The Cart King. Jalopy parts are put together with different elements such as horns, gears, metal components and even fabric curtains, resulting into contraptions that proclaim the virtues of a nomadic life. Demet dela Cruz’ Fire Starter, with oil on wood, mixed media and LED lights, make up a powerful and beautifully-rendered saddled horse proudly marching into battle with classical figures populating its pedestal and a melee raging right behind it. For Mike Seiling, an acrylics on canvas diptych, Austere Illusions, might be likened to an alien satellite, with elements spewing out streams of color and a queue of familiar shapes disappearing into the distance with an economy of lines and embellishment. His video installation, Discombobulated Entities, bears the same minimalism and sensitivity.
                Cuvos’ subject might an antlered bear either existing in symbiosis with colorful birds, or a predator biding his time in As We Will, So Shall It Be Done. The creatures appear calm and comfortable in their natural habitat, notwithstanding the weird assembly of body parts. This fantastic sight is offset by Lilim, Jim Orencio’s sawdust and acrylics on canvas painting that speaks of calm respite, quiet moments and a pocketful of sunshine as one breathes in nature, positive energies enveloping us as a force field against the turmoils of daily living.
                While a rich spectrum of interesting juxtapositions are produced with the combination of the works in #artfusion!, the praxis brought forth by each artist differentiates himself from the rest in intent, treatment and execution, making this amalgamation of forms within the show truly an intriguing blend.
